Hi! I am Saqib Nazir, I am a PhD student and assistant researcher at CEOSpace Tech. I specilized in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. My primary area of research revolves around developing innovative methods for Monocular depth estimation using defocus cues.

Currently, I am working on a project with the European Union titled "European Training Network (ETN) MENELAOS NT". The project aims to develop advanced technologies for 3D imaging, perception, and interaction with the environment using computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.

As a part of my work, I published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My research contributions have been widely recognized and have earned him prestigious awards and accolades.

Prior to joining CEOSpace Tech, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from a renowned university. I then pursued a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, where he focused on developing advanced deep learning models for object detection and recognition. After completing my Master's degree, I worked as a research assistant at a leading research institute, where he gained significant experience in developing state-of-the-art machine learning models.


I enjoy working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds. I have experience working with small, agile teams to deliver software that is problem oriented and reliable. I am an independent engineer and I value initiative, knowledge sharing, good coding practices.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).

Here is my [resume](/files/cv-jrenault-2022.pdf) (in french).

Please contact me with any questions (email on the left).
