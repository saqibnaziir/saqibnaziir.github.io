Hi, there! I'm Saqib. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University Politechnica Bucharest, working with Prof. Daniela Coltuc and Mihai Datcu as a member of the CEOSpace Tech. lab. 
I am specializing in the field of 3D computer vision and graphics. My primary research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, and Machine Learning, with a particular focus on developing innovative approaches for Monocular depth estimation utilizing defocus cues.

At present, I am engaged in a collaborative project funded by the European Union entitled "European Training Network (ETN) MENELAOS NT." The objective of this project is to advance technologies in the areas of 3D imaging, perception, and environmental interaction, employing computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.

Throughout my career, I have made significant contributions to the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, as evidenced by the publication of numerous papers in esteemed conferences and journals. These research endeavors have garnered widespread recognition and prestigious awards.

Prior to joining CEOSpace Tech, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from a renowned university. Subsequently, I pursued a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, where my focus revolved around the development of sophisticated deep learning models for object detection and recognition. Following the completion of my Master's degree, I served as a research assistant at a prominent research institute, thereby acquiring substantial expertise in crafting cutting-edge machine learning models.

I thoroughly enjoy collaborating with interdisciplinary teams encompassing diverse backgrounds. My experience encompasses working alongside small, agile teams to deliver problem-oriented and dependable software solutions. As an autonomous engineer, I highly value proactivity, knowledge sharing, and the adherence to sound coding practices.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).
