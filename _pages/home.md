Hi, there! I'm Saqib. I am a Ph.D. student in the Faculty of [Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology](http://www.electronica.pub.ro/) at the [University Politechnica Bucharest](https://upb.ro/en/), working with Prof. Daniela Coltuc and Prof. Mihai Datcu as a member of the [CEOSpace Tech.](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/) lab. 
I specialized in the field of 3D computer vision and the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, and Machine Learning in this field. My primary area of research revolves around developing innovative methods for Monocular depth estimation utilizing defocus blur as a cue and Image defocus deblurring.


Currently, I am working as an Early-stage Researcher (ESR) in the European Training Network (ETN) H2020-MSCA-ITN [MENELAOS-NT](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/) project. The project applies Novel Technologies to realize multimodal – multi-sensor data fusion to optimally combine the information delivered by different sensors (in-situ/remote, optical/non-optical) on different scales, with different resolutions, and with different reliability. The objective of this project is to advance technologies in the areas of 3D imaging, perception, and environmental interaction, employing computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.

As a part of my work, I published several papers in top-tier conferences and peer-review journals in the field of computer vision and image processing. My research contributions have been widely recognized and have earned prestigious awards and accolades.

Prior to joining CEOSpace Tech, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from COMSATS Univeristy Islamabad, Pakistan. Subsequently, I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, where my focus revolved around the development of sophisticated deep-learning models for Medical Image Processing. Following the completion of my Master's degree, I served as a research assistant at a prominent research institute at COMSATS Univeristy Islamabad, Pakistan, thereby acquiring substantial expertise in crafting cutting-edge machine-learning models.

I thoroughly enjoy collaborating with interdisciplinary teams encompassing diverse backgrounds. My experience encompasses working alongside small, agile teams to deliver problem-oriented and dependable software solutions. As a Computer Vision engineer, I highly value proactivity, knowledge sharing, and adherence to sound coding practices.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).
