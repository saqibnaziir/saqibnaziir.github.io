Assistant Reseracher for [European Training Network (ETN) MENELAOS](https://www.menelaos-nt.eu/) mission. Acquiring 3D geometry of the scene is essential for many applications in the areas of navigation, robotics, scene understanding, etc. Among the existing approaches, those using passive devices are of increased interest since they allow the use of compact, standard and low cost imaging systems like DSLR cameras. There are many depth cues that can be used to extract the 3D geometry. In single shot images, the depth is laying in the blur, shadows of objects, chromatic effects and shape distortions caused by lens aberrations, etc.  When multiple images are used, depth information comes from perspective change like in binocular systems or structures motion in video sequences. The physics of these effects is well known and more or less accurate mathematical models exist and are used by analytical image processing methods that are generally prone to heavy calculation.
The entrance of the newcoming Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on the stage of signal processing has boosted the subject due to their capability to learn complex models that ingest multiple effects, not only single ones as analytical approaches are doing. The flexibility in learning and the fast processing once the training is accomplished make DNNs a very promising tool in building the 3D geometry of scenes from easy-to-acquire images.
